    <h4>THE OPPORTUNITY</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Goal #1: using the application would let the university unique and higher ranking
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Recommendation #1: let the university take the idea and work on it with big companies (solution for
            computer application only record students’ data). Thus, the applications will be bigger and takes more
            data for Employee, finance data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        OUR PROPOSAL
    </h4>

    <p>Zyad’s company has well Awareness of how-to frontend the software very well. Thus, it cares on delivery time
        with high quality, moreover any future issues will be addressed as soon as possible for getting the best
        impact from the clients.
        To follow the trend that universities make applications for them self’s that would let the university has
        good impact and will attract other students since our university stopped using “Microsoft excel” and begin
        to use its pure own product. Therefore, my company product will replace using “Microsoft excel” from the
        university.
    </p>

    <h4>
        EXPECTED RESULTS
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Replacing “Microsoft excel” from the university.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>All the university staff using it.
        </li>
    </ul>
